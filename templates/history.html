<h1>Moghuls History</h1>

<p>The Moghuls were a Muslim dynasty that ruled over much of South Asia from the 16th to the 19th century. They were descended from the Timurid dynasty of Central Asia, and their empire was one of the largest and most powerful in the world at its peak.</p>

<p>The Moghuls were great patrons of the arts and architecture, and their reign saw the construction of some of the most iconic buildings in India, including the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort. They also encouraged trade and commerce, and their empire was a major center of trade between the East and the West.</p>

<p>The Moghul Empire began to decline in the 18th century, due to a number of factors, including internal conflicts, foreign invasions, and economic problems. The empire was finally dissolved in 1857, after the British East India Company defeated the last Moghul emperor in the Indian Rebellion of 1857.</p>
