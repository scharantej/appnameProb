 ## **Python Flask Expert Assistant**

### **Problem Analysis**
The problem at hand is to build a website that focuses on the struggles faced by actors. To effectively address this, we will design a Flask application that provides information, resources, and support to aspiring and struggling actors.

### **Flask Application Design**
Our Flask application will consist of the following components:

#### **HTML Files**
- **index.html**: This will serve as the homepage of our website, providing an introduction to the purpose of the website and offering navigation options to other pages.
- **about.html**: This page will provide detailed information about the website's mission, goals, and the team behind it.
- **resources.html**: This page will list various resources available to actors, such as acting classes, workshops, audition tips, and industry contacts.
- **support.html**: This page will offer emotional support and guidance to actors facing challenges, potentially including a forum or contact information for professional help.
- **contact.html**: This page will provide contact information for the website administrators, allowing users to reach out with questions or suggestions.

#### **Routes**
- **@app.route('/')**: This route will render the **index.html** page, serving as the entry point to our website.
- **@app.route('/about')**: This route will render the **about.html** page, providing information about the website and its creators.
- **@app.route('/resources')**: This route will render the **resources.html** page, listing the available resources for actors.
- **@app.route('/support')**: This route will render the **support.html** page, offering emotional support and guidance to actors.
- **@app.route('/contact')**: This route will render the **contact.html** page, displaying contact information for the website administrators.

### **Additional Considerations**
- To enhance user experience, we can incorporate CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactive elements.
- We can also consider implementing a blog or news section to provide updates and insights related to the acting industry.
- For user convenience, we can include a search functionality to allow actors to easily find the resources they need.

By following this design, we can create a comprehensive and informative website that caters to the needs of struggling actors, providing them with valuable resources, support, and guidance.
